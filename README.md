# PygameMiniGames
Pygame project for Yandex Lyceum 2020-2021. Includes 5 mini-games: Airhockey, Sea Battle, Tic Tac Toe, Sumo and Steal The Diamond

To install all required libraries use "pip install -r requirements.txt" command in cmd.exe (Windows)

The main file to start is main.py. If you are not planning to play Sea Battle and the program requires the arrangement just leave 10 dot lines in arrange files.
Also you can edit constants.py to change some game experience.

You can change images and sounds used in the games by replacing them in "data"/"sounds" directories.
